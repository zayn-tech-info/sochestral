# Sync Maintenance Guide (main thread)

You, the main thread, read and follow this at write time (Step 3). Read each ALL_CAPS placeholder as the matching input you gathered in the earlier steps.

You are maintaining a project's durable knowledge after a code change. Your job is narrow, the steps below define all of it; stay inside them. Be conservative: when in doubt, flag rather than write.

**Canonical file:** durable context lives in the tool agnostic **`AGENTS.md`**; **`CLAUDE.md` is only a pointer** importing its sibling AGENTS.md via Claude Code's `@` directive. Never write content into a CLAUDE.md, never overwrite an existing AGENTS.md. When you create a new nested `AGENTS.md`, also create its sibling `CLAUDE.md` containing only:
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

This project's context for all AI tools lives in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).
Claude Code loads it via the import below:

@AGENTS.md
```

## The change

- **Scope mode**: MODE
- **Base / merge base**: BASE / MERGE_BASE
- **Changed source files (with status A/M/R)**: CHANGED_FILES
- **Deleted paths (status D, for orphan cleanup only)**: DELETED_PATHS

See exactly what changed with:

```
DIFF_COMMAND
```

**Default to doing nothing.** Code that doesn't alter a command, convention, constraint, dependency, or structural layout does not belong in durable knowledge; a line that just narrates what this change did is churn, not maintenance. A `NOTHING_TO_SYNC` run is a normal, good outcome.

## Existing context files (you may EDIT these; you may CREATE a nested AGENTS.md + its CLAUDE.md pointer for a net new area only)

- **Root AGENTS.md (inlined)**:

ROOT_AGENTS_MD

- **Nested AGENTS.md paths**: NESTED_PATHS
- **Changed file → nearest context file**: FILE_TO_CONTEXT_MAP

## Specs (you may reconcile ONLY the `**Status**:` line; you may FLAG staleness, you must NOT edit any other spec content)

SPEC_PATHS

## Feature scope for the relevant workspace(s) the diff touches, NOT all of docs/scope/ (you may RECONCILE status only, never add/remove/reorder features)

SCOPE_PATH_OR_NONE

## Tool discovery result from the main model

- **Installed Agent Skills**: INSTALLED_SKILLS_OR_NONE
- **MCP servers selected or recommended**: MCP_SERVERS_OR_NONE
- **Declined or skipped tools**: DECLINED_TOOLS_OR_NONE

---

## What to do

### 1. Update existing AGENTS.md files (only where the change made them inaccurate)

Read the diff. For each existing root/nested AGENTS.md whose area was touched, check whether the change altered a command (build/test/run/scripts), a convention, constraint, or dependency, broke a file pointer (target moved or removed), or added a new durable rule that belongs in that existing doc.

Make the edit only if it is:
- **Surgical**: change or add specific lines, never rewrite sections.
- **Additive or corrective**: add a missing fact or fix a wrong one. Never delete curated guidance you don't fully understand.
- **Durable**: true beyond this one change. Skip one off notes, history, and feature summaries.

### The mirrored root fields

<!-- ROOT-FIELD-CONTRACT:START (identical in /audit and /sync; edit both or neither) -->
Root `AGENTS.md` carries two mirrored fields. Each has exactly one source of truth outside the file, and no skill may invent a value for either:

- `## Stack` mirrors the architecture spec, the one under `docs/specs/` with a `## Proposed stack` section.
- `## Build approach` mirrors the scope header's build approach line, the one `/scope` records.

Three rules bind every skill that touches them. Never overwrite curated prose in either field. Fill a field only when it is missing or still a placeholder. When a field and its source disagree, flag the divergence and name the file you read the source from, rather than picking a winner.
<!-- ROOT-FIELD-CONTRACT:END -->

What `/sync` does with them: reconcile, one line at a time.

- **Missing the value its source sets** (e.g. a greenfield root seeded before the architecture spec landed, or a root with no build approach line while the scope header names one): add that one line surgically, and record it under `AGENTS_UPDATED`.
- **Field and source disagree**, or root's version is elaborated curated prose, or you cannot tell which side is authoritative: do not overwrite. Flag it under `CONFLICTS`, naming the spec or scope file you compared against.

`/sync` never restructures root or creates it; that is `/audit`'s job (see the Boundaries table in `SKILL.md`).

**Agent Skill and MCP records:** if `INSTALLED_SKILLS_OR_NONE`, `MCP_SERVERS_OR_NONE`, or `DECLINED_TOOLS_OR_NONE` is not `none`, record it surgically in the most specific relevant AGENTS.md:
- Project wide tools (framework, ORM, styling, core DB, hosting, test runner) belong in root AGENTS.md.
- Area specific tools (payments, auth, email, uploads, search, queues) belong in that area's nested AGENTS.md when one exists; otherwise add a short root note and flag the area under `CONTEXT_GAPS`.
- An installed skill goes in the `## Agent skills` section as its own bullet so only needed skills load: `- [<skill>](<skills-dir>/<skill>/): `<owner>/<repo>`, <what it covers>`, using the project's real skills dir (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, or `skills/`, never a hardcoded Claude only path, since every tool reads this file) and keeping the registry source `<owner>/<repo>` as the tool agnostic identity. Create the `## Agent skills` section if the doc lacks one (append near the end, before `## Context files` in root); never fold skills back into a single dense line of names.
- A declined tool and a connected/recommended MCP server stay compact lines in that section (they have nothing to load): `Declined: <tool>` · `MCP servers: <server> (connected|recommended)`.
- Idempotent: if the same installed, recommended, connected, or declined item is already recorded (even worded differently), do not add it again.
- Record selected MCPs as recommended unless the main thread explicitly says connected.

**Design system pointer:** if this change added or established a `design.md` (the UI design system, art direction plus the build mandate) and the nearest AGENTS.md has no pointer to it, add one surgical line so the mandate is discoverable and loads automatically for UI work: `` - Design system: build all UI to `design.md` (art direction and the maximalist product bar); token values live in CSS. `` Put it in root AGENTS.md for a project-wide `design.md`, or the UI area's nested AGENTS.md if the system is area-scoped. Idempotent: skip if a `design.md` pointer already exists. Never paste design.md content into AGENTS.md; it is a pointer, not a copy.

Rules you must not break:
- **Idempotent, check before you add.** Read the target doc again now (a teammate or another session may have edited it). If the fact, command, or pointer is already present, even worded differently, do not add it again: /sync run twice on the same change must make zero new edits the second time.
- **Never overwrite or rewrite curated prose.** If accuracy would require rewriting an author's curated paragraph, record it under `CONFLICTS` for a human instead.
- Keep root AGENTS.md short and globally relevant; area specific detail belongs in a nested doc.

### 2. Create a nested AGENTS.md: only for an area NET-NEW in this change

You may create **one** nested `<area>/AGENTS.md` for an area the change introduced wholesale. The test is **context, not policy**:

- **Create it** when every source file in that area carries status `A` (added) in CHANGED_FILES: the diff shows you the entire area. If any file in the area is `M` (modified), the area already existed: do NOT create. Write a focused doc: local file pointers, local commands, conventions/constraints visible in the new code, links to any governing spec. End it with the one line note: `_Drafted by /sync from the introducing change, worth a quick human pass._` Then add exactly one pointer line to root AGENTS.md under `## Context files`:
  ```
  - [<area>/AGENTS.md](<area>/AGENTS.md): <one-line description>
  ```
  **Idempotency + missing section**: skip the pointer if already present; if root has no `## Context files` heading, create it (append near the end of root) and add the pointer under it.

  Also create the sibling **`<area>/CLAUDE.md` pointer** (a one line note plus `@AGENTS.md`) so Claude Code picks up the new area too.
- **Area that already exists, defer to /audit**: the diff shows only a slice of an area that predates this change, so you lack the whole area context to write a good doc. Record it under `CONTEXT_GAPS`.
- **Never create or restructure the root AGENTS.md.** If the repo has no root AGENTS.md at all, that's /audit's job; record under `CONTEXT_GAPS`.
- One nested doc per genuinely distinct new area, never one per folder.

### 3. Clean up orphans from deletions

For each path in DELETED_PATHS:
- A nested `<area>/AGENTS.md` describing code that no longer exists is orphaned. Remove it only if the whole area was deleted (the directory is gone); if only some files went, correct the now broken file pointers inside the doc instead.
- When you remove a nested doc, also remove its pointer line from root's `## Context files`.
- Fix any file pointer in any AGENTS.md that targets a deleted/moved path.
- Record removals under `ORPHANS_CLEANED`. If unsure a deletion is permanent, flag under `CONFLICTS` instead of deleting.

### 4. Reconcile linked specs' Status line (edit ONLY the `**Status**:` line, never spec content)

A spec's status mirrors its feature's build lifecycle:
- `Proposed`: not yet built (scope `planned`).
- `In Progress`: being built (scope `in-progress`).
- `Accepted`: built and verified (scope `done`); a spec is not `Accepted` until its feature ships.
- `Superseded`: replaced by a later spec (never set this from scope status; flag under `STALE_SPECS` instead).

For an **umbrella decision**, reconcile the linked `index.md` (child specs carry no status and are not reconciled).

This applies **only to specs that link to a buildable scope feature.** A **standalone decision spec** (a foundational/stack or cross cutting standard with no linked feature) is decision status: `Proposed` when written, `Accepted` once ratified, never feature mirrored. Leave it as is; do not reconcile or flag it under `STALE_SPECS` (e.g. "no linked feature found") merely for having no linked feature, that is expected, not a mismatch. Only genuinely stale/superseded standalone specs (Step 5) get flagged.

For each spec whose linked feature appears in the reconciled scope:
1. Find the feature this spec governs (its title/links reference a scope feature, which may link back).
2. Read the feature's current scope status and derive the target spec status from the mapping above.
3. **Read the spec again just before writing** (a teammate or another session may have edited it). If the `**Status**:` line already equals the target, do nothing (idempotent). Otherwise make a single surgical edit to that one line only.
4. Record the change under `SPEC_STATUS_RECONCILED`.

**Do not guess.** If a feature linked spec is ambiguous (no confident link to exactly one feature, unclear mapping, status already `Superseded`, or a downgrade you can't explain), do not edit; flag the mismatch under `STALE_SPECS` and leave the line as is.

### 5. Flag stale specs (do not edit their content)

Be **strict**, noise erodes trust. Read a spec only if the changed paths plausibly touch its subject (judge from its title/first lines; don't read all blindly). Flag it **only when you can name the specific decision the change contradicts**, e.g. the spec mandates one datastore and this change adds an adapter for a different one, or the spec fixes an interface/boundary the change breaks. Also flag a spec a **later spec supersedes** (its status should become `Superseded`, /architect's job, not a Status line reconciliation). Never flag vague "might be affected" cases; when in doubt, do not flag. Record genuine hits under `STALE_SPECS` with the contradicted point and recommend /architect to update or supersede; never edit spec content yourself.

### 6. Reconcile the feature scope (only if SCOPE_PATH_OR_NONE is a path)

**Scope:** only the scope file(s) you were handed. Never hunt for or reconcile other files under `docs/scope/`; one workspace's change does not license editing another's.

You are the **universal sub task reconciler**: `/develop` ticks its own sub tasks; `/test`, `/audit`, and `/sync` sub tasks have no one else. For **every feature the diff touched**, evaluate each of its sub tasks again against repo evidence (not just what this diff added) and tick the genuinely complete ones: the diff picks *which features* to check again, the repo state decides *which sub tasks are done*. Look directly with Read/Bash/Grep/Glob.

**Malformed scope** (no `At-a-glance` table or feature sections, a status that is not standard, broken headings, a bad hand edit): do not edit it; note `scope malformed: <file>, needs a human or /scope re-run` under `SCOPE_RECONCILED` and skip it. Never act on a misread.

> Step 1's source file filtering (dropping `*.test.*`, `docs/**`) governs what you sync AGENTS.md from; it does not limit reconciliation. Here you may and should inspect test files, AGENTS.md, and config to judge completion.

Evidence per sub task type (tick `[ ]` → `[x]` when the evidence is clearly present):
- **UI / data model / backend / integration / data integration** → the corresponding files exist in the feature's code area (components/pages, schema/migrations, services/endpoints, the mock replaced by a real query).
- **Build it (+ milestones)** → the feature's code exists in its area (milestone chunks present); `/develop` usually ticks these itself.
- **Verify it** → a `verify.md` beside the spec, or a recorded passing runtime verification for the feature.
- **Test it** → test files cover this feature's area (search the area + test dirs).
- **SEO & metadata** → metadata/structured data present on the feature's pages.
- **Sync (record conventions)** → the area's `AGENTS.md` exists and reflects the feature.
- **Coding standards / tooling** → linter/formatter/`pre-commit` config present in the repo.

Then update the feature's **status**, in the `At-a-glance` table AND beside its heading: `in-progress` while any box (`Build it` + its milestones, `Verify it`, `Test it`) is unticked; `done` **only when `Design`, `Build` (+ milestones), `Verify`, and `Test` are all ticked**.

- **Strictly status only.** Never add, remove, rename, or reorder features or checkboxes (that's /scope's). Skip `existing` and `dropped` features entirely. Never invent a feature for code that has no section; if shipped code clearly matches no feature, note "unmapped: <area>, run /scope to enroll this off plan work" under `SCOPE_RECONCILED`.
- **Attribution across features and workspaces.** Only tick a sub task when the file→feature mapping is **unambiguous** (the file lives in that feature's code area and matches that sub task). In a monorepo, a changed file's **workspace** (`apps/<x>/…`) selects the scope to update, `docs/scope/<x>/`; never tick a feature in the wrong workspace's scope. If an area maps to more than one feature, do not guess; note `ambiguous: <area> → <featureA> / <featureB>` under `SCOPE_RECONCILED`.
- **Idempotent**: a box already `[x]` stays `[x]`; running it again changes nothing.
- **Conservative**: tick only on clearly present evidence; when unsure, leave it.
