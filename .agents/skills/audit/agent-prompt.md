# Audit Writing Guide (main thread)

You, the main thread, read and follow this when you write the `AGENTS.md` files. It is written as a brief with ALL_CAPS placeholders; read each placeholder as the matching input you gathered in `pre-flight` and the question rounds (the list in each phase mode file). You do the writing yourself; the only subagent this skill uses is a read only `scout` that reads a large codebase and returns a compact map, on the cheapest model.

---

You are running /audit in **PHASE** mode. Use your Read, Bash, Write, and Edit tools freely.

## Canonical context file: AGENTS.md (+ a CLAUDE.md pointer)

Durable context goes in `AGENTS.md` (root or `<area>/AGENTS.md`), tool agnostic, read by every agent. For each `AGENTS.md` you create, create a sibling `CLAUDE.md` importing it via Claude Code's `@` directive (Claude reads CLAUDE.md and loads AGENTS.md automatically; other tools read AGENTS.md directly). `@AGENTS.md` resolves relative to the CLAUDE.md, so a nested CLAUDE.md imports its sibling nested AGENTS.md:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

This project's context for all AI tools lives in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).
Claude Code loads it via the import below:

@AGENTS.md
```

Hard rules:
- Never overwrite an existing `AGENTS.md` (possibly authored by the user or another tool). Create only when missing; otherwise propose additions via the diff format.
- `CLAUDE.md` only ever holds the pointer; never duplicate AGENTS.md content into it.
- Migration (when told `MIGRATE=yes`): copy the legacy `CLAUDE.md` content verbatim into a new `AGENTS.md`, then replace `CLAUDE.md` with the pointer above. Never discard curated content.
- A `CLAUDE.md` pointer that already points to AGENTS.md stays untouched.

## Stamp what you write, so curated content is knowable

Every `AGENTS.md` this skill creates ends with the drafted by line in the templates below. It exists so a later run (this skill or `/sync`) can tell what a tool wrote from what a human wrote, instead of guessing.

- **Creating a file**: end it with the drafted by line, exactly as the template shows.
- **Gap filling a file that still carries the line**: the untouched parts are yours to correct; add or fix facts surgically, and leave the line in place.
- **Gap filling a file with no drafted by line**: a human has taken it over. Add missing facts only, never rewrite an existing line, and route anything that would change existing prose to CONTRADICTIONS.

The stamp records provenance, not permission. It never licenses overwriting a line someone edited, and the "never overwrite curated prose" rule in the contract below holds either way.

## The mirrored root fields

<!-- ROOT-FIELD-CONTRACT:START (identical in /audit and /sync; edit both or neither) -->
Root `AGENTS.md` carries two mirrored fields. Each has exactly one source of truth outside the file, and no skill may invent a value for either:

- `## Stack` mirrors the architecture spec, the one under `docs/specs/` with a `## Proposed stack` section.
- `## Build approach` mirrors the scope header's build approach line, the one `/scope` records.

Three rules bind every skill that touches them. Never overwrite curated prose in either field. Fill a field only when it is missing or still a placeholder. When a field and its source disagree, flag the divergence and name the file you read the source from, rather than picking a winner.
<!-- ROOT-FIELD-CONTRACT:END -->

What `/audit` does with them (every phase that writes or audits root):

- **Creating root** (greenfield, whole-repo): populate `## Stack` from the architecture spec if it exists (the source of truth, even on greenfield with no code); else derive from the code/manifest, else `<to be filled>`. Seed `## Build approach` from the scope header if one exists, a short line: name + one line principle; if no scope, or none set, write `<TBD, set by /scope>` rather than guessing.
- **Auditing existing root** (gap-fill): either field missing or placeholder → ROOT_GAPS; either field contradicting its source → CONTRADICTIONS.

This keeps the `/architect → /audit` handoff order-independent: root absorbs the decided stack whenever audit runs.

### GREENFIELD phase

New project, possibly just scaffolded from its chosen stack (there may be a manifest and scaffold source, but no real feature code yet, and usually an architecture spec that decided the stack). Create a root AGENTS.md encoding the engineer's chosen standards.

**Step 1: Minimal discovery**

With your file tools, list the top couple of project levels (excluding `.git`); read the manifest if present (note language, package manager). Check `docs/specs/` for numbered specs (`NNNN-*.md`); if an architecture spec exists (`## Proposed stack` section), read it: the stack is already decided via `/architect`, use it for `## Stack`, no placeholders, never contradict it. Check `docs/scope/` (or `.workflow/scope/`): if the scope header records a build approach (name + one line principle), capture it verbatim as the `## Build approach` seed; else `<TBD, set by /scope>`.

**Step 2: Create root AGENTS.md**

Use the template below. `## Stack`: spec, else findings, else `<to be filled>`. `## Build approach`: scope header, else `<TBD, set by /scope>`. `## Rules`: base on SELECTED_PATTERNS (Read it if given as a path); if "Other" free text was chosen, include it verbatim, never interpret or reformat it; append ADDITIONAL_STANDARDS as extra bullets at the end.

If `INSTALLED_SKILLS_OR_NONE` is provided, write a `## Agent skills` section (template above): ONE bullet per installed skill, `- [<skill>](<skills-dir>/<skill>/): `<owner>/<repo>`, <what it covers>`, so a later skill loads only the ones a task needs, never a single dense line of names. Detect the project's real skills directory (`.claude/skills/` on Claude Code, `.agents/skills/` on other agents, or a plain `skills/`) and use it in the link; never hardcode a Claude only path, since every tool reads this file. Keep the registry source `<owner>/<repo>` on each bullet as the tool agnostic identity a different agent resolves in its own dir. If `DECLINED_TOOLS_OR_NONE` is provided, add a compact `Declined: <tool>, <tool>` line in that section (a decline has nothing to load, so it needs no location; it stops a later `/audit` or `/architect` offering it again). If `MCP_SERVERS_OR_NONE`, add a compact `MCP servers: <server> (connected|recommended)` line (a connected service has no local file to open). Project wide tech at root; area specific at that area's nested doc, using the same `## Agent skills` section.

Monorepo: keep root to monorepo wide concerns (workspace tooling `pnpm`/`turbo`/`nx`, shared standards, a `## Context files` section pointing at each workspace's nested doc); per app stack does not go in root.

**Step 2b: Per workspace nested AGENTS.md (monorepo only)**

If `MONOREPO_OR_NO` is `yes`: for each listed workspace (`apps/*`, `packages/*`), read its manifest. Even with no features built, the scaffold declares the workspace's stack and commands; capture them so `/architect` and `/develop` read them from the workspace's own doc (they won't look in root). Write `<workspace>/AGENTS.md` with the nested template (`## Stack` from its manifest, `## Commands` from its scripts, scoped, e.g. `pnpm --filter <name> dev`, root `## Rules` inherited by reference), plus the sibling `<workspace>/CLAUDE.md` pointer and a pointer line under root's `## Context files`. Skip an empty placeholder workspace with no manifest.

**Step 3: Report** (format at the bottom); list every per workspace doc created.

---

### WHOLE-REPO phase

A codebase exists but no AGENTS.md. Explore enough to write an accurate root AGENTS.md.

**Step 1: Discover**

With your file tools, list the project tree a few levels deep, skipping vendored/generated dirs (`.git`, `node_modules`, `.next`, `dist`, `build`). Read whichever exist:
- `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml` / `go.mod`: stack and deps
- `.github/workflows/`: CI and deploy patterns
- Main entry point (`src/index.*`, `main.*`, `app.*`, `server.*`)
- Test config (`jest.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `vitest.config.*`)
- All existing `AGENTS.md` (excluding `.git`); for each nested one found (not the root), add a pointer line under `## Context files` when writing root: `- [<path>](<path>): <one-line description inferred from the file's ## Overview section>`.

**Step 2: Extract durable knowledge**

Stack, runtime, framework; daily commands (install, dev, build, test); conventions visible in the code (naming, file structure, patterns); what would trip up a new developer in week one. Discard implementation details, TODO comments, anything that changes frequently.

**Step 3: Create root AGENTS.md** with the template below; global and short (≤60 lines), area detail goes in nested docs (next step).

**Step 4: Create nested AGENTS.md**

Monorepo (`MONOREPO_OR_NO` = yes): don't judge or deep scan. Every workspace (`apps/*`, `packages/*`) gets a light stub `AGENTS.md` at its root (`## Stack` + `## Commands` from its manifest, scoped, e.g. `pnpm -F <name> …`, plus a one line overview), the sibling `CLAUDE.md` pointer, and a root `## Context files` pointer. No code scan; deep conventions come later via `/audit <workspace>`. A doc buried below a workspace root (e.g. `packages/ui/src/mdx/`) with no root doc: follow the relocation rule the main agent surfaced (move up, or root doc + linked nested). Skip the judgment step below.

Single repo: identify the major areas/modules (e.g. `src/auth`, `src/payments`, `src/api`, `src/jobs`); judge each. Warrants a nested doc: distinct conventions, not obvious rules, local commands, external integrations, or gotchas a developer must know before touching it. Does not: a simple module with no surprises, or root already covers it (skip; never one per folder). For each warranted area: write `<area>/AGENTS.md` with the nested template, its sibling `<area>/CLAUDE.md` pointer, and one pointer line in root's `## Context files` via Edit:
```
- [<area>/AGENTS.md](<area>/AGENTS.md): <one-line description>
```
Global facts in root; area knowledge kept alongside the area's code (it loads automatically when that code is edited).

**Step 5: Report** (format at the bottom); list every nested doc created.

---

### AREA phase

Root AGENTS.md exists. Job: (1) check whether root AGENTS.md has what this area needs, (2) create or update the nested AGENTS.md.

**Step 1: Explore the area**

With your file tools, list all files under `SCOPE_OR_AREA`. Read: key source files (entry points, main modules, not every file, use judgement); test files in this area; any local config (tsconfig, .env.example, etc.); the existing root and area AGENTS.md (provided above; Read them if given as paths).

**Step 2: Gap check root AGENTS.md**

Flag a gap only if it is: a command engineers working in this area need but root doesn't mention; a stack element, runtime, or major dependency relevant to this area but absent from root; a hard project wide rule the area makes visible (e.g. "all DB calls go through the repository layer"). Do NOT flag area specific file lists, local conventions, or anything that belongs in a nested file.

Collect gaps in this format for the final report under `Root gaps flagged`:

```
ROOT_GAPS:
- <exact markdown line to add>, target section: `## <section>`, reason: <one line>
```

If no gaps: `ROOT_GAPS: none`. Keep the exact text to insert so you can apply it with Edit without paraphrasing.

**Step 3: Nested AGENTS.md**

Warrant (own patterns, not obvious rules, local commands, or constraints a developer needs to know first) vs not (a simple CRUD module with no surprises, or already well covered by root AGENTS.md).

- Missing + warranted → create with the nested template, then add a pointer to root AGENTS.md (all root modifications via Edit): `## Context files` holding only a placeholder comment (`<!-- ... -->`) → replace the comment line with the pointer; existing entries → append the pointer line; section absent → add the section and pointer before `## specs` (or at the end if no specs section).
- Missing + not warranted → note why in the report and skip.
- Exists → propose additions only (never overwrite), via the diff format below.

**Step 4: Report** (format at the bottom).

---

### GAP-FILL phase

Root AGENTS.md already exists; the codebase is partially documented. Audit the whole codebase against the existing docs and fill only what's genuinely missing; never rewrite curated content.

**Step 1: Read what's documented**

Read the existing root AGENTS.md (provided above; Read it if given as a path) and every nested AGENTS.md (paths provided above).

**Step 2: Scan the codebase**

With your file tools, list the project tree a few levels deep, skipping vendored/generated dirs (`.git`, `node_modules`, `.next`, `dist`, `build`). Read the manifest(s), CI config, entry points, and a sample of each major area; build a picture of the real stack, commands, conventions, and major areas.

**Step 3: Find four kinds of finding**

- (a) Global facts missing from root: a daily command, stack element, project wide rule, or the build approach (in the scope header but absent from root) that's true but not recorded. Collect each as a `ROOT_GAPS` line (exact markdown + target section) and apply it only with the engineer's permission (the gap handling step in `modes/gapfill.md`), never silently, since a root line may be curated.
- (b) Undocumented areas: a major area with distinct conventions/gotchas and no nested AGENTS.md. Create the nested doc (nested template + sibling CLAUDE.md pointer) and add its root pointer line via Edit (safe to do directly: creating, not overwriting).
- (c) Stale/incomplete nested docs: an existing nested AGENTS.md missing something now true of its area. Return as `PROPOSED_ADDITIONS`; do NOT edit it yourself.
- (d) Contradictions: a doc states something the codebase or its governing records disprove (documented test runner or framework isn't the one actually used; `## Stack` conflicts with the architecture spec; `## Build approach` differs from the scope header; a documented command no longer exists). Worse than a gap, the docs are actively wrong; do NOT fix it automatically (the line may be curated). Collect each as a `CONTRADICTIONS` entry naming the doc, what it says, and what the code/spec/scope actually shows; surface these to the human, don't fix them automatically.

Be conservative: flag only durable findings you're confident about; when unsure, leave it. Do not flag implementation detail, TODOs, or anything that churns.

**Step 4: Report** (format at the bottom). Put (a) under `Root gaps flagged`, (c) under `Proposed`, (d) under `Contradictions`, and list (b), the nested docs you created, under `Written`.

## Root AGENTS.md template

=== ROOT AGENTS.md TEMPLATE START ===
# <Project name>

## Stack

- **Language / Runtime**: <e.g. TypeScript, Node 20>
- **Framework**: <e.g. Next.js 14, Express>
- **Key dependencies**: <3 to 5 most important>
- **Package manager**: <npm / pnpm / yarn / pip / cargo>

## Build approach

<The project's default build strategy, a short line: name + one line principle. A project wide
 convention every skill reads (like the stack). Seeded from the scope header; `<TBD, set by
 /scope>` if none is set yet. The approach is one of:
 - **Tracer Bullet**, vertical end to end slices, thin but complete through every layer
 - **Skateboard**, ship the thinnest usable whole, then grow it
 - **Facade**, UI first shell, then wire the real behavior behind it (prototype led)
 - **Journey**, build the full user path, one phase at a time>

## Commands

```bash
# Install
<command>

# Dev server
<command>

# Build
<command>

# Test
<command>
```

## Specs

Stored in `docs/specs/`. Format: `docs/specs/NNNN-title.md`.

## Rules

<Conventions that apply everywhere, from pattern presets and/or discovered from code.
  For greenfield: paste the selected pattern conventions here.
  For whole-repo: extract what you observe in the code.
  Keep this to 5 to 10 bullet points max.>

## Agent skills

<Installed Agent Skills that carry this project's tool conventions. ONE bullet per skill so a
  later skill (/architect, /develop) opens only the ones a task needs, never a single dense line
  of names, and omit the whole section if none installed. Each bullet: the skill name, its
  registry source `<owner>/<repo>` (the stable, tool agnostic identity), a one line note on what
  it governs, and a link to where it lives IN THIS PROJECT. The skills directory is agent specific:
  detect the real one this project uses (`.claude/skills/` for Claude Code, `.agents/skills/` for
  other agents, or a plain `skills/`) and use that, never hardcode a Claude only path, since every
  tool reads this file and resolves the source in its own skills dir. Only project wide skills go
  here; an area specific skill goes in that area's nested AGENTS.md.>
- [<skill>](<skills-dir>/<skill>/): `<owner>/<repo>`, <one line: what it governs>

<Then, only if present, a compact line each (a declined tool has nothing to load, and an MCP
  server is a connected service with no local file, so both stay lines, not bullets):
  `Declined: <tool>, <tool>` (offered before, not wanted; keep so a later /audit or /architect
  does not offer it again) · `MCP servers: <server> (connected), <server> (recommended)`>

## Context files

<!-- Nested AGENTS.md files are listed here as they are created -->

_Drafted by /audit from the repo, worth a quick human pass. Edit freely: once a line stops matching this draft, later runs treat it as curated and will flag rather than overwrite it._

=== ROOT AGENTS.md TEMPLATE END ===

## Nested AGENTS.md template

```markdown
# <Area name>

## Overview

<2 to 3 sentences: what this area does and why it exists>

## Key files

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| <path> | <what it does, one line> |

## Commands

<Local commands if different from root, omit section if identical>

## Conventions

<Bullet list of area-specific conventions, constraints, and non-obvious rules>

## Gotchas

<Non-obvious invariants that would trip a developer, omit section if none>

## Agent skills

<Area-specific installed skills, same bullet format as root (name, registry source, note, and a
  link to the detected project skills dir, never a hardcoded `.claude/` path), omit section if none:
  - [<skill>](<skills-dir>/<skill>/): `<owner>/<repo>`, <what it governs for this area>
  A declined tool or MCP server stays a compact `Declined:` / `MCP servers:` line, as in root.>

## Related specs

<Links once specs exist, omit section if none yet>

_Drafted by /audit from the repo, worth a quick human pass. Edit freely: once a line stops matching this draft, later runs treat it as curated and will flag rather than overwrite it._
```

## Proposed diff format (when a file already exists)

Do not overwrite. Output this block and stop:

```
PROPOSED_ADDITIONS for <file path>:

Under `## <section>`, add:

<exact markdown to insert>

Reason: <one line>
```

Only propose what is absent and genuinely useful. Do not rewrite existing content.

## Report format (end of every phase)

```
## /audit complete

**Phase**: <greenfield | whole-repo | area | gap-fill>
**Scope**: <what was explored>

**Discovered**:
- <finding>
- <finding>

**Written**:
- <file path> (<created | pointer added | updated>)

**Root gaps flagged** (area / gap-fill phases):
<ROOT_GAPS output or "none">

**Proposed** (existing files):
<PROPOSED_ADDITIONS block or "none">

**Contradictions** (gap-fill phase, docs the code disproves; for a human to resolve):
<CONTRADICTIONS entries or "none">
```

---

## Rules you must not break

- Write the `AGENTS.md` files with your file tools; don't paste their full contents back into the chat. When the phase is done, produce the report block at the end as your working summary for the relay.
- ROOT_GAPS goes under `Root gaps flagged` in that summary. Keep the exact markdown text to insert so you apply it (with the engineer's permission) without paraphrasing.
- Do not create a nested AGENTS.md unless the area genuinely warrants it.
- Root AGENTS.md must stay under ~60 lines. Cut ruthlessly.
- Never overwrite an existing AGENTS.md, propose additions only via the diff format.
- Do not create specs. Do not write plans. Stay in your lane.
- Proposed additions must be additions only, no rewrites of existing sections.
- When the engineer selected "Other" for architecture style, use their free text verbatim in `## Rules`. Do not interpret or paraphrase it.
